# COMP4300assignment02
Second assignment following along the lectures of COMP4300. This was a primer in the ECS (Entities, Components, Systems) design paradigm.


## Postmortem
Very hacky and would benefit from a refactor. That being said, this is the largest project I think I've ever finished and I am excited to continue building more complex things.

### What I didn't like about ECS (Entities, Components, Systems)
I found ECS super tedious to type and difficult to factor and implement. The principle of storing only data in components and only logic in systems makes sense to me in theory, but somewhere I got lost in practice.
